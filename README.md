# Superscalar-OOO-Pipeline-Sim
A 9-stage Out-of-Order Pipeline Simulation for ECE 563 at NC State University, Fall 2022.

# Result:
Varying Issue Queue (IQ) and Reorder Buffer (ROB) yields significant variations in key performance metrics, and we determine a setup that is
considered optimal for each input set.
